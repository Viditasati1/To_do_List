This is a To_do_list application which is my first javascript project.
 you can add your daily tasks 
 cross them when finished them up 
 delete them whenever you want
 Hope you love it (Feel free to give any suggestions on its functionality responsiveness)
 I also added a feature in the code of saving your todos on local storage as there is no database till now.
